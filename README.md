Your code uses Python's turtle module to draw letters of the alphabet. Each letter is rendered in a random color with adjustable speed settings. The screen size adjusts based on the length of the user’s name, and spaces are managed to ensure correct alignment. This project combines graphics, user input, and color customization.
