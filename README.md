# Name_drawer_machine
Your code uses Python's turtle module to draw letters of the alphabet. Each letter is rendered in a random color with adjustable speed settings. The screen size adjusts based on the length of the userâ€™s name, and spaces are managed to ensure correct alignment. This project combines graphics, user input, and color customization.
